## Introduction

The **Geopolitical Analytical Tool** draws on concepts from a balance-of-power simulation used by the Pentagon during the Cold War era to train U.S. State Department officials in foreign policy analysis. The app provides insight into a country's global influence based on its ability to forge strategic alliances and maintain national security.

## Features

- **Geopolitical Rating**: Analyze a country's geopolitical prestige based on alliances and diplomatic influence.
- **Tiered Power Structure**: Classify countries as Tier One or Tier Two powers.
- **Visual Rating Outcome**: Display of geopolitical status using a chessboard metaphor:
  - **Green Zone**: High geopolitical prestige.
  - **Yellow Zone**: Vulnerable position.
  - **Red Zone**: High geopolitical risk.

## Application Concept

In geopolitics, prestige is a measure of influence and respect a country commands globally. This tool allows users to simulate and visualize the impact of alliances with Tier One and Tier Two nations, and how these alliances affect a nation's standing. Tier One nations include global powerhouses (e.g., United States, China), while Tier Two includes emerging economies (e.g., Brazil, India).

A country with significant influence over these tiers can leverage military and economic partnerships to isolate adversaries and strengthen its own position. Prestige can lead to real power and influence without direct conflict, providing nations with a peaceful pathway to international prominence.

## Geopolitical Rating System

- **Green Area**: The black king chess piece in this area signifies high geopolitical prestige. The nation has solid alliances and a respected status globally.
- **Yellow Area**: Indicates a mid-level, potentially unstable position in the international sphere.
- **Red Area**: This zone suggests high vulnerability and increased risk of geopolitical crises.

Countries positioned in the Green area can influence major international decisions and counter rivals through strategic alliances, while those in the Red are at risk of external pressures or conflict.

## Deployment

The Geo-Political Analytical Tool is hosted on GitHub for easy access and distribution. The app is continuously updated for performance, security, and UI enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript framework used for building the front end.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling to create a responsive and clean UI.
